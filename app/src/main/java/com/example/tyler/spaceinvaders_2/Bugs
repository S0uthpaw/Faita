TODO:
Implement:
* Main ship
* Enemy ship 1,2,3,4
* Main menu
* Boss ship (if room)

Also:
* Game Over




---------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed:

* Buttons are very slow when switching between activities

* After opening options activity and navigating back to the main menu, the exit button on MM
    takes the app back to the options screen rather than closing app. It possibly has something to
    do with both buttons existing in the same screen space. The exit button functions normally if
    you open options, navigate back with the Android back button, and then click exit as well as if
    you open the main game activity and navigate back with the Android back button.

* All buttons take 2 clicks to execute whatever code they are suppose to
